The Amazing Audio Engine
========================

The Amazing Audio Engine is a sophisticated framework for iOS audio applications, built so you don't have to.

It is designed to be very easy to work with, and handles all of the intricacies of iOS audio on your behalf.

Built upon the efficient and low-latency Core Audio Remote IO system, The Amazing Audio Engine lets you get to work on making your app great instead of reinventing the wheel.
