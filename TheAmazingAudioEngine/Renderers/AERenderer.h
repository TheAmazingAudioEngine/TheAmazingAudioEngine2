 * Render loop block
 *
 *  Use the render loop block to provide top-level audio processing.
 *
 *  Generate and process audio by interacting with the buffer stack, generally through the use of
 *  AEModule objects, which can perform a mix of pushing new buffers onto the stack, manipulating
 *  existing buffers, and popping buffers off the stack.
 *
 *  At the end of the render block, use @link AERenderContextOutput @endlink to output buffers on the
 *  stack to the context's output bufferList.
 *
 * @param context The rendering context

/*!
 * Base renderer class
 *
 *  A renderer is responsible for driving the main processing loop, which is the central point
 *  for audio generation and processing. A sub-renderer may also be used, which can drive an
 *  intermediate render loop, such as for a variable-speed module.
 *
 *  Renderers can provide an interface with the system audio output, or offline rendering to
 *  file, offline analysis, conversion, etc.
 *
 *  Use this class by allocating an instance, then assigning a block to the 'block' property,
 *  which will be invoked during audio generation, usually on the audio render thread. You may
 *  assign new blocks to this property at any time, and assignment will be thread-safe.
