 * File output

 *  This class implements an offline (i.e. faster-than-realtime) render to file.
 *  It can be used in place of AEAudioUnitOutput, for instance, and will write
 *  to disk rather than sending audio to the device output.
 *
 *  It can also be used in multi-track mode, outputting each stereo channel pair
 *  to a different audio file.
 *
 *  Note that because this class runs the render loop as fast as it can write
 *  to disk, it isn't suitable for render loops that receive live audio.
