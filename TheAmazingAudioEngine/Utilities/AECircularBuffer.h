/*!
 * Circular buffer
 *
 *  This utility provides a thread-safe and lock-free FIFO buffer that operates on AudioBufferLists 
 *  and tracks the AudioTimeStamps corresponding to the audio.
 *
 *  It provides a convenience wrapper to TPCircularBuffer and its AudioBufferList utilities, by avoiding
 *  the need to provide an AudioStreamBasicDescription to the various functions, among other things.
 *
 *  It's generally preferable to use this interface instead of TPCircularBuffer if you're just
 *  using the TAAE audio format (non-interleaved float).
